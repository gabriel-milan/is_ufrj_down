# Is UFRJ down?

Ever tried to access an UFRJ website with no success? This repository contains minor code for checking if UFRJ internet is down.

## Just do it!

- Do whatever you want in order to acquire the `check_ufrj.py` script and then just run:

```
python3 check_ufrj.py
```

- If you want to check it in a loop, just do:

```
python3 loop_check.py
```

That's it for most purposes!
