# Is UFRJ down?

Ever tried to access an UFRJ website with no success? This repository contains minor code for checking a few UFRJ HTTPS servers.

This is hosted at [https://gabriel-milan.github.io/is_ufrj_down/](https://gabriel-milan.github.io/is_ufrj_down/)

## Adding servers to the list

Requirements:

- Must be HTTPS
- The server must provide a valid SSL certificate when requested

If requirements are met, please submit an issue with the hostname you want to add to the server list.
